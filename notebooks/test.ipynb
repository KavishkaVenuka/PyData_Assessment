I don't think there's a problem occasionally playing on such pitches. There was something on offer but it was slowish movement, if you were old school, who knows, you could've scored a few more. We were fortunate to get some early wickets. There's some variety in our attack, there are different wickets - some high-scoring, some like this, so we need to have balanced attack. We didn't have too many conversations about net-run-rates, those two at the top (Guptill and Munro) are aggressive anyway. Nice that they could go out and play some few shots, Munro played with freedom which was outstanding.

To be stood in this position when you arrive in India with high hopes it incredibly tough, incredibly disappointing. It hurts a lot. We certainly haven't done ourselves justice. Fancied ourselves to have a real go at it. Incredibly tough to reach those highs [winning in 2019] and everyone knows the work that goes into that. Feel like we've let people down. You wear that on your own shoulders. [Happy chasing 287] Yeah, thought so, could have been better - frustrating partnership between Zampa and Starc, could have finished it quicker. Having come up 30 runs short, there's certainly areas we can find those 30 runs. [Dismissal] I think it was the right shot to play, execution was off. Felt that was the time to throw something back at the opp. My own form has been the biggest concern. I came in in a great place, but my own form has really hurt us.

Great achievement for the whole team and this is the kind of opportunity we have been working hard for. Wonderful performances by the bowlers and the batters. (On his responsibility with the new ball) As a spinner, it is pretty hard to bowl in the powerplay. But I have been working in the nets. There is not much room for error to bowl wide so I have tried to bowl wicket-to-wicket. We knew that dew will play some part and that is why I wanted to bowl in the powerplay. The ball was holding a little bit as well. Even if there was dew, I was mentally prepared. Not to give much room and bowl in the right areas. (On the batting) It is all about the management. They have been giving me confidence. I want to contribute as a lower-order batter as well, and those 25-30 runs helps the team as well. I want to continue doing that. I want to dedicate this award to the people back home, who have been affected by the earthquake. This is something we could do as a team and I could do myself as a player.            2023         India\n",

Firstly, we bowled and fielded well. We thought they were par. We thought we had a good chance at 2 for 120. Probably a bit of instinct. So many of our bats bowl spin. De Leede is a quality cricket in all three departments. His innings was awesome, just needed someone to be with him. Not spoken to van Beek, need to see where he's at. This is a game that got away. We know they have quality bowlers but they took wickets which held us back.            2023         India\n"
