Dilshan did that, then later came together with Tharanga and reminded us of Headingley [in 2006]. The guys fought hard, especially fielding first, and they kept up the pressure. It's been a fantastic crowd, hopefully they've enjoyed the cricket. Murali has pulled up a bit stiff but I'm sure he'll be fit for the next game. We can't get too far ahead of ourselves, we just have to keep our heads down.\"            2011     Sri Lanka\n",

Darren Bravo played really well, but we managed to peg it back in the middle. We tried to mix it up in the middle. Once you pick a wicket, you can build pressure and we managed to pick up wickets in clusters. My batting wasn't the best - I have been a little ill coming into the game, so I just wanted to bat through with AB and build a partnership. AB went faster than run a ball and paced it real well. Long time to our next game, good vibe in the group and we will take some time off.\"            2011         India\n",

We did well in the batting too, but credit goes to Bumrah for the way he bowled in the last three overs. He was superb. (On his bowling) The wicket was really good for batting during the first half. The spinners stuck to the plan, and they did really well. We had other options than Rashid and Mujeeb, but in the backend, Aftab and I also bowled well, but India is a good side, and a favourite side. The total was not that much (to chase) but in the middle, we needed some 80s and 100s, 20s and 30s aren't enough against a team like this. When chasing 220s, you need some batsmen to take responsibility and go longer. We have lost four games very badly, but last two games we have played really well. This is tough cricket against high-ranking teams, and you have to fight your best.\"            2019       England\n",

They've been through more close games than any other team in this tournament, and until today they'd been finishing on the right end of those results. Against Bangladesh, South Africa, West Indies, India - have I missed any? Today, in the closest finish imaginable - tied match, tied Super Over, losing on boundary count - they've come out on the wrong side. It's going to take a while for them to get this out of their systems.            2019       England\n",

One or two curious shots, and batters got out at crucial stages. it's happened twice in two games, and we really need to look at that. (On short bowling) We probably didn't read the pace of the pitch. Having said that, defending 213 wasn't easy. (Fitness) We've been carrying some niggles in recent weeks, and we need to take care of that. There's no point looking back. We can only control the future.\"            2019       England\n",

The plan was to go through to the end and give my 100%. When we started, the plan was to see out Ferguson. But when Santner came on, the plan became not to give wickets to him and cover up later when the fast bowlers come on. The fans support us here in Birmingham, it's great.            2019       England\n",

We at least wanted to end with a small smile. Rassie's innings was a great example for young batters. He was on 5 off 30 balls or something but hung in there. To hang in a period shows maturity. They're champion human begins. Immy is like the heartbeat of the team and JP is the father figure of the team and we will miss them.

I don't think there's a problem occasionally playing on such pitches. There was something on offer but it was slowish movement, if you were old school, who knows, you could've scored a few more. We were fortunate to get some early wickets. There's some variety in our attack, there are different wickets - some high-scoring, some like this, so we need to have balanced attack. We didn't have too many conversations about net-run-rates, those two at the top (Guptill and Munro) are aggressive anyway. Nice that they could go out and play some few shots, Munro played with freedom which was outstanding. It was a good allround performance, focus turns quickly to the next match in a few days time on a different surface.\"            2019       England\n",

But if you win the match... as you saw we lost at the end of the innings. Bad luck for us today, Hamid Hasan was injured. The wicket was slow and turning, credit to Nabi, Mujeeb, Rashid and Sami also. But we missed Hamid. I said at the start of the tournament 30-40 is not enough, you need 60-70 or 100, then you can put a good total. But each batsman, including me, should go one step forward. We are learning a lot, so hopefully we'll do well in the future. Thank you to the tremendous crowd here.\"            2019       England\n",

Credit to the openers. They played really well. Then Babar took over. And Haris Sohail put in a great performance. We changed the combination in this game. Couple of games earlier, we went with other combination. That's the only thing. Sometimes change is good for the team. Today the way Haris batted, he is hungry to play in the game. He's the main factor, the turning point, the way he batted in the last 15 overs, it was like Jos Buttler. We have to work harder on fielding. Again we dropped so many catches today. All three matches now are very crucial and we have to sort it out. Complete bowling effort. Credit goes to Amir, took early wickets and in the middle overs as well.

I'm happy that Pathum, Sadeera and Dilshan are coming through. I think in the future we'll have a very good team which shows promise. We had a couple of injuries, and that was the reason we had so many changes and newcomers. But we also made mistakes; had we played better cricket, we would have a better chance of entering the top four. It's very disappointing. When Mathews came to the crease, there were five seconds left. When he came out, he found out about the strap of the helmet. It was disappointing. We expected him to score runs for us; it's disappointing that the umpires couldn't step in and make good decisions.\"            2023         India\n",

[Lost toss] Bit gloomy, swinging around so wasn't too upset. [Fielding] Something we talk a lot about. Wasn't up to scratch at the start of the tournament. Davey, 37, diving around, incredible. And the big two up front were incredible. [Head] Has this knack of finding a wicket. Been different bowlers chip in through the whole tournament. [Inglis] Played that beautifully. He looked in control against two really good spinners on a tough wicket. The good thing is a few of us have been there for finals before. Got to embrace it, the stadium is going to be packed, pretty one-sided but got to embrace it. The 2015 World Cup was a career highlight, so to be out there in a final in India, can't wait.\"            2023         India\n",

I looked for swing early on but didn't get it so then I kept it simple and hit the right areas and that was the plan for the spell and I got success in it. We struggled in the past in the last overs...gave away too many runs but we bowled with variations today and the hard work in net sessions helped, couple of days rest also worked in our favour. We tried to bowl as many variations as possible. Thank you            2023         India\n",

We were put under pressure against England. In the last game as well, we lost a wicket in the first over but got to a good score and seamers came to the party. Today was not an easy pitch, you needed someone like Kohli, who batted to the situation. Not to forget Shreyas. It's important to let guys have freedom in the middle and what the team expects from them. You know it can't always be done but when it does it looks good and that's what happened with Shami. Same with Iyer, wasn't getting the runs but he's showed in the last two games the kind of class he has. Going hard in the first ten isn't something we've discussed. That's how Gill and I have batted together. We let our instincts take over. If the wicket is good, we keep going and things fall in place. Jadeja has been really good. Big matchwinner. He keeps doing the job, goes under the radar but today is a classic case of what he does - score late runs and take wickets. Not to get ahead of ourselves is something we are constantly talking about. When we turn up, we want to play to our potential.            2023         India\n",

Feel like we're having the same chat after every game. Some improvements again today but still short. It's a low point. To be stood in this position when you arrive in India with high hopes it incredibly tough, incredibly disappointing. It hurts a lot. We certainly haven't done ourselves justice. Fancied ourselves to have a real go at it. Incredibly tough to reach those highs [winning in 2019] and everyone knows the work that goes into that. Feel like we've let people down. You wear that on your own shoulders. [Happy chasing 287] Yeah, thought so, could have been better - frustrating partnership between Zampa and Starc, could have finished it quicker. Having come up 30 runs short, there's certainly areas we can find those 30 runs. [Dismissal] I think it was the right shot to play, execution was off. Felt that was the time to throw something back at the opp. My own form has been the biggest concern. I came in in a great place, but my own form has really hurt us. [Netherlands next] Only way you can get back into form is keep going. The longer it goes on, the closer you are to coming out of it.\"            2023         India\n",

I did a lot of hard work in the past. The team management deserves credit. I was a little bit cautious in my mind early on while bowling but the captain told me to bowl at the right areas and told me to be consistent and that gave me confidence so credit goes to the captain. (on batting) I go for ball by ball and how to get better on this surface. The wicket was turning a little bit but I tried to stay (on the crease). I always play at number 8 so it was a great opportunity to bat in the top order. I always have the hungriness so definitely it's a great moment for me to perform.            2023         India\n",

Handled the challenge with the ball nipping around. We applied pressure with the ball. We tried to pounce on bad balls, Quinny started slowly, hung in there and cashed in at the end. More than the score, we were trying to stay in till 30 and go big later on. We were always looking to dominate with the new ball and middle overs. Knew they'd come hard at us and we'd get opportunities. Gotta hear the permutations about making the semi.

A couple of big-match players stepped up and chuffed. Today we thought it was a good night to chase and thought it would be easier to chase. The pitch was slower than I thought and didn't particularly spin and we bowled tight lines. On a slow wicket with variable bounce, we had a couple of catchers on the leg side and made a couple of decisions. Desperate for sure. The boys were fantastic against South Africa. We have an ageing side but everyone throws themselves around. Chuffed with keeping them to 240 - anything under 300 really. I was one of those blokes with the hearts fluttering but Head takes the game on, Marnus... I think the selectors backed him even when he had a broken hand. It's a big risk and it paid off. How fun is he to watch? It was awesome to play and the passion in India is unrivaled. You just got to go and win a World Cup. You can't wait for it. It was a shift after two games.

I wanted to make a big contribution. Have made fifties in World Cups, wanted to finish it off this time. (Free hits to start off) I was telling Shubman that even if you dream about this situation, you go back to sleep. It was a dream start. It just calms you down. The pitch was good, allowed me to play my game - hit the gaps and find the boundaries whenever I could. Great atmosphere in the dressing room. The spirit is there for everyone to see. You need to create some momentum in the changing room to come out and play like this. Special feeling to play in front of such crowds.            2023         India\n",

Great achievement for the whole team and this is the kind of opportunity we have been working hard for. Wonderful performances by the bowlers and the batters. (On his responsibility with the new ball) As a spinner, it is pretty hard to bowl in the powerplay. But I have been working in the nets. There is not much room for error to bowl wide so I have tried to bowl wicket-to-wicket. We knew that dew will play some part and that is why I wanted to bowl in the powerplay. The ball was holding a little bit as well. Even if there was dew, I was mentally prepared. Not to give much room and bowl in the right areas. (On the batting) It is all about the management. They have been giving me confidence. I want to contribute as a lower-order batter as well, and those 25-30 runs helps the team as well. I want to continue doing that. I want to dedicate this award to the people back home, who have been affected by the earthquake. This is something we could do as a team and I could do myself as a player.            2023         India\n",

Shaheen started well with the ball. After 15-20 overs, they built a partnership. But our main bowlers struck. Main thing was our bowlers hit good lengths and took wickets.

Nail-biting finish, if you are a South African fan, you are a little bit happier, we haven't done well in chasing, it will be easier to have those conversations now. I think obviously we have a blueprint, batting first, we have shown, we can't say with conviction we have the blueprint while chasing but we will have the conversations. We obviosuly want to show more clinical display with the bat. (Rabada) is good, he is experiencing lower back spasm, I am sure he will come into contention for New Zealand game. Ecstatic for Shamsi, He came in favourable conditions and exploited it and then with the bat I think you've seen Shamsi on social media gloating about his batting, we needed that today and fortunately for us he came through.            2023         India\n",

I was scratching around so Quinton needs to be credited a lot. I'd be really greedy if I said there were areas to improve, a near-perfect game with the bat, and with the ball, looking at all the phases, the guys dominated and showed their skills. Got to acknowledge the batting effort, being over-par, and we were clinical with the new ball, then KG following up with intensity, then the spinners. Character is the biggest thing we talk about, and we showed it today. Let's enjoy the individual performances, then come back tomorrow and find ways to get better and better as a team.\"            2023         India\n",

First up it's Najmul Shanto in place of the injured Shakib Al Hasan: \"Shakib has gone for a scan after that we'll know more. We didn't bat well, same as the last match. We need to improve in the first 15 overs. There was a bit of extra bounce with the new ball but after that the wicket was quite. The top order needs to bat more responsibly. It was a good wicket, so we just needed to be a bit more responsible at the start. Last match we didn't bowl well but today everyone showed their character. If they continue like this it will be very good going forward. The biggest improvement is our fast bowling, if we bat well in the next few games it will be a different ball game.\"            2023         India\n",

Disappointed in myself and all the boys that we haven't shown a good account of ourselves. There's no clear answer at the moment [as to why that's the case]. Can't really fault the boys efforts but we're playing a long way short of our best. It starts from the front, as Captain you want to lead from the front and play well and I've been a long way short of my best. [Confidence drained away?] Not really to be honest, there are a lot of experienced cricketers in the room, who've been through a lot - confident people. You don't become a bad player overnight, you don't become a bad team over night. I think that's probably the biggest frustration, that we've been so far short of our best, and for no obvious reason. Just can't put my finger on it at the moment. [uncertainty over strategy?] Selection is something you want to be consistent, build that trust. But selection isn't a problem at the moment, performance is. Whoever has been on the field so far has been short of the standards we set ourselves. The kind of mistakes we're all making, you don't see that usually. We haven't been doing the basic things well. [What to cling to?] The biggest thing is personal pride, whatever happens in the rest of the tournament we want to give a good account of ourselves going forward..\"            2023         India\n",

It was probably that nothing was said and it was just on the back of two losses...The energy in the field was nice to start with and everything else flowed. Again, they started really well but the way all the bowlers came in, hit the wicket, and did their job, it was a great effort. I can't read these wickets. About 300 [would've been par] maybe. Outside noise doesn't bother us too much. I hope so, all parts of the game came together at the end. We're sort of underway in the tournament and hope we keep it up.            2023         India\n",

You are not going to chase down 320 with 40s and 50s...we needed to bigger partnerships. We will speak about that with the boys.

Firstly, we bowled and fielded well. We thought they were par. We thought we had a good chance at 2 for 120. Probably a bit of instinct. So many of our bats bowl spin. De Leede is a quality cricket in all three departments. His innings was awesome, just needed someone to be with him. Not spoken to van Beek, need to see where he's at. This is a game that got away. We know they have quality bowlers but they took wickets which held us back.            2023         India\n",
